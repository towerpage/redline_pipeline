NON‑DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

This Non‑Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is made and entered into as of ____________, 20__ (the “Effective Date”), by and between Discloser, a party possessing certain confidential and proprietary information, and Recipient, an entity or individual who may receive and handle such information (each a “Party” and together, the “Parties”).

1. Definitions    
      1.1 “Confidential Information” shall mean any and all data, materials, documents, specifications, designs, drawings, models, samples, reports, analyses, or any other information furnished by Discloser, whether in written, electronic, graphic, oral, or any other form, but only to the extent that such information is labeled or otherwise identified in writing by Discloser as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure. Confidential Information shall not include information which (a) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of Recipient; (b) was rightfully in Recipient’s possession prior to receipt from Discloser; (c) is rightfully obtained by Recipient from a third party having the right to disclose; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information.

2. Confidentiality Obligations    
      2.1 Recipient agrees to exercise at least the same degree of care to safeguard the confidentiality of Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own similar confidential materials, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care.    
      2.2 Recipient may use Confidential Information solely for its own internal business purposes, including, without limitation, evaluation, analysis, or discussion concerning a potential business relationship or transaction with Discloser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, officers, affiliates, agents, subcontractors, and consultants (collectively, “Representatives”) who have a bona fide need to know such information in connection with the permitted uses set forth above, provided that Recipient has first obtained binding confidentiality obligations from such Representatives that are no less stringent than those set forth in this Agreement.

3. Permitted and Restricted Uses    
      3.1 Recipient shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than the specific purpose defined in Section 2.2. Recipient shall not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive any trade secrets or confidential know‑how embodied in any Confidential Information.    
      3.2 Any unauthorized use, disclosure, or duplication of Confidential Information shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

4. Term and Termination    
      4.1 This Agreement, unless earlier terminated as provided below, shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated by either Party providing five (5) days’ prior written notice to the other Party, at which time Recipient’s obligations with respect to Confidential Information received prior to termination shall survive for a period of three (3) years from the date of last disclosure.    
      4.2 Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve Recipient of its obligations hereunder with respect to Confidential Information disclosed prior to the effective date of termination.

5. Return or Destruction of Materials    
      5.1 Upon written request of Discloser or upon termination of this Agreement, Recipient may, at its sole discretion, either return to Discloser or destroy all physical and electronic embodiments of Confidential Information. Recipient shall not be obligated to provide any certification or other proof of destruction or return of materials.

6. Disclosures Required by Law    
      6.1 If Recipient or any of its Representatives is required by applicable law, regulation, or judicial or governmental order to disclose any Confidential Information, Recipient may do so without prior notice to Discloser and without seeking to limit the scope of such disclosure. Recipient shall have no obligation to notify Discloser or cooperate in any efforts to seek a protective order or other limitation on the scope of such compelled disclosure.

7. Ownership; No License    
      7.1 All Confidential Information, and any derivatives, adaptations, or modifications thereof, shall remain the exclusive property of Discloser. Recipient hereby acknowledges that it obtains no right, title, or interest in or to the Confidential Information except as expressly set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Discloser hereby grants Recipient a non‑exclusive, royalty‑free, worldwide license to use the Confidential Information solely for the purposes expressly permitted under this Agreement.

8. Indemnification    
      8.1 Neither Party shall have any liability to the other for any unauthorized disclosure, use, or loss of Confidential Information. Recipient shall not be liable for any breach of confidentiality, and Discloser waives any claims for damages or injunctive relief.

9. Assignment    
      9.1 Recipient may freely assign, transfer, or delegate its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any affiliate, successor, or acquirer, without the need for any consent or notice to Discloser. Discloser may assign its rights and obligations hereunder without restriction.

10. Notices    
      10.1 All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt); or (c) on the date sent by email (with electronic confirmation of transmission). Email shall suffice as notice notwithstanding any failure of the intended recipient to receive such email.

11. Governing Law; Oral Agreements    
      11.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of any jurisdiction selected by Recipient in its sole discretion, without regard to conflict‑of‑law principles.    
      11.2 The Parties agree that any oral agreements, understandings, or representations shall be legally binding, and no written amendment or signature shall be necessary to effectuate any modification to this Agreement.

12. Miscellaneous    
      12.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, and understandings of any kind.    
      12.2 If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.    
      12.3 No waiver by either Party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.
